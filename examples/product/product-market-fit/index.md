# Product Market Fit


## Level 0: None/Never

This level is when everything is merely brainstorms and drawings on napkins.


## Level 1: Initiate/Investigate

This level is when founders start talking to people:

* People who are in potential markets i.e. relevant industries and sectors. 

* People who are potential customers i.e. have relevant purchasing power and roles. 

* People who are potential product users e.g. have relevant practices and goals.

Work looks like: 

* Lots of market comparisons, probes, landing pages.

* Lots of customer interviews, task analyses, value stream maps.

* Lots of product sketches, mockups, wireframes, low-code/no-code/POCs.

Success looks like: 

* Commit to a specific market sector, customer purchaser role, product task goal.

* Share company introductions e.g. investor slide deck, business model canvas, simple small website.

* At least 3 early evangelists in each area who are NPS > 0 and/or give you MOU/LOI/money/funding.


## Level 2: Develop/Deliver

This level is where the startup works on market development, customer development, product development.

* Do market development by researching the ecosystem (e.g. competitors, collaborators, table stakes).

* Do customer development by researching the purchasing arc (e.g. from cold contact to signed payment).

* Do product development by showing target users the offering (e.g. embarrasingly-bad MVPs that actually do real work).

Work looks like: 

* Enter the market and iterate on positioning, pricing, comparisons, channels.

* Acquire customers who are early evangelists and who will iterate with you.

* Build the product and iterate, emphasising value prop, covering all table stakes. 

Success looks like: 

* Channels are working and ROI is proving it.

* Customers are paying and NPS > 0.

* Product is working and metrics are proving it.


## Level 3: Standardize/Scale

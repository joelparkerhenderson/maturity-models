<th>Leadership<br />approach<br />toward Lean</th>
<td>Company executives demonstrate no understanding of the Lean approach</td>
<td>Executives demonstrate an understanding of the Lean approach</td>
<td>Executives demonstrate an understanding or Lean but do not have full faith</td>
<td>Executives demonstrate good understanding and have faith in Lean. Leadership committed but not prepared for accelerated biz improvement</td>
<td>Sr. execs have full understanding and faith in Lean; leadership prepared for accelerated biz improvement</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>Employee<br />involvement</th>
<td>Little or no involvement of people in process improvements</td>
<td>Involvement of people in process improvements to some extent and people are eager to work in teams</td>
<td>People form cross-functional teams whenever a problem arises</td>
<td>Quality improvement, problem solving and corrective action teams in place. 25 to 50% of employees involved in teams</td>
<td>50% or more involved in teams; open access to top management; empowered to stop the process for quality</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>Training/<br />Education</th>
<td>No training on Lean tools or quality improvement tools, methodologies or even concepts</td>
<td>Few team members have heard about different concepts of improvement methodology but not formally trained</td>
<td>Team members are trained in some basic concepts like 5S, Lean overview, 7 QC tools</td>
<td>Team members have good understanding of process improvement methodologies</td>
<td>More than 5% of employee time devoted to training and implementing improvements</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>Process<br />capability</th>
<td>The area of assessment has sigma level less than or equal to 1, for its most critical process. Cpk is less than or equal to 0.33</td>
<td>The area has sigma level greater than 1 but less than or equal to 2. Cpk lies between 0.33 and 0.66</td>
<td>The area has sigma level greater than 2 but less than or equal to 4. Cpk lies between 0.66 and 1.33</td>
<td>The area has sigma level greater than 4 but less than 6. Cpk lies between 1.33 and 2</td>
<td>The area has sigma level greater than or equal to 6. Cpk is greater than or equal to 2</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>Approach<br />to errors</th>
<td>Errors will happen; inspect them out; accept cost of scrap and rework; deal with customer complaints</td>
<td>Although errors happen but some initial thought prevails to implement or design error-free systems using Lean</td>
<td>Inspection and control only; some data collection to regulate variance</td>
<td>Inspection, control and improve; data collected to regulate variance</td>
<td>Zero-defect quality mindset</td>

<tr>
<th>Data driven<br />problem solving</th>
<td>Insufficient data available for key processes needing improvement</td>

<td>MSA is done extensively and people know the tools needed to analyze data</td>
<td>Org uses data driven problem solving methods across the spectrum</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>Methodologies of continuous improvement (CI)</th>
<td>No formalized improvement methods exist. No evidence of employees, or managers concerned about CI</td>
<td>Improvements reactive &#8211; usually come from management, engineering, supervision or when a customer complaint is received. Some training started in problem solving</td>
<td>Some improvement methodology evident; teams sometimes used to develop solutions. CI training supported by management</td>

<th>Value stream<br />mapping</th>
<td>No process is mapped according to the value stream</td>
<td>An understanding of VSM is evident. Some attempts have been made to map a simple process</td>
<td>A number of people have been trained in VSM, some processes mapped. No improvements</td>
<td>Most understand value of VSM. Mapping has uncovered opportunities for improvement. Action plans are in place. Rapid improvement blitzes preceeded by VSM</td>
<td>Most processes mapped with results of action plans recorded</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>Accounting<br />support<br />to Lean</th>
<td>Accounting system provides basic financial data based on cost accounting. There is little awareness of accounting&#8217;s role in support Lean initiatives</td>
<td>There is an awareness that accounting has a role in Lean. Some staff has been trained and initial analysis has been undertaken</td>
<td>All key staff has been trained. Pilot project has begun; department targeting waste in its processes</td>
<td>Key value streams are using Lean. Decisions are being made using Lean financial data. Some initial investigation to review current standard cost methods</td>
<td>Accounting system provides financial data based on measurements at the value stream level and provide support for Lean</td>
</tr>

A few words of guidance:

- Technical Leads begin at level L5.

- At levels L5 and L6, tech leads can transition into the IC role seamlessly (T5/T6) and vice-versa.

- Each level builds on the criteria from the preceding level. A L7 must also meet all the criteria for a L6.

- For a given level, meeting the specified number of years of relevant experience is not strictly required. However, every year short is harder to account for concerning promotions or hiring. Years of
  relevant experience are important in establishing a track record since it takes time to assess the significance of long-term decisions. Time served in industry or academia cannot stand alone. Your
  experience should also be relevant to level criteria.

- The criteria for each level are guides, not strict requirements. Excellence in one criteria may counter-balance weakness in another. It is common for individuals to spike their performance to higher levels
  either temporarily or on individual criteria.

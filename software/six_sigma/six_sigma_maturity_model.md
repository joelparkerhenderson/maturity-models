# Six Sigma Maturity Model

See https://www.isixsigma.com/implementation/basics/maturity-model-describes-stages-six-sigma-evolution/

The five levels:

* 1. Launch – This is the starting point – wherein an initial few visionaries in the organization launch Six Sigma, training is initiated and projects are begun.

* 2. Early Success – The initial projects are yielding results and early successes are being achieved.

* 3. Scale and Replication – The early success has led to other parts of the organization buying in to Six Sigma and a broader launch of projects is under way.

* 4. Institutionalization – Throughout many parts of the company, projects are yielding broad-based financial impact.

* 5. Culture Transformation – Six Sigma is part of the organizational DNA, financial impact is sustained and the Six Sigma culture is pervasive – even beyond the Six Sigma practitioners and beyond the company boundaries.

<th>Strategy Maturing</th>

<td>-</td>

<td>-</td>

<td>Map, Goals:	Creation of strategy maps to ensure that the mass of projects under way
are aligned with corporate and organizational priorities</td>

<td>Project Roll-up: Strategy maps at corporate and organizational level; going beyond alignment,
to actually launch projects to impact the strategic goals</td>

<th>Software</th>

<td>-</td>

<td>Excel, Stats: Focus is on statistical tools for the Belts</td>

<td>Project Tracking: Software goes beyond statistical tools to project tracking; consistent application of methodology and financial impact reporting is ensured</td>

<td>Portfolo Mgt.: Project tracking typically evolves to include knowledge management and portfolio management</td>

<td>Strategy + Portfolio: Integrated portfolio and strategy management across the enterprise; replacement of legacy applications by vendor applications</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<th>Reporting</th>

<td>Anecdotal</td>

<td>Aggregate, Average: No consistency yet, no roll-ups because number of projects is still small</td>

<td>Aggregate, Average:	Enough projects completed so that average impact per project, per Belt, etc.
can be predicted; aggregate impact across the organization is significant</td>

<td>Cross-org Comps.: Comparison of results for each organizational unit; aggregate corporate-wide results are reported</td>

<td>Multi-Year History: Comparison of results for each organizational unit routinely done; aggregate corporate-wide results are reported</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<th>Financial Impact</th>

<td>Ad hoc: None yet, no projects completed</td>

<td>Cost Reduction: Initial results are having some impact; usually focused on cost reduction</td>

<td>Consistency, EP: Consistent measures of impact are in place</td>

<td>Validation: Strict controls in place to ensure validation of results; measures evolve to include revenue impact</td>

<td>General Ledger: Strict controls in place to ensure validation of results; measures include revenue impact</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<th>Project Selection</th>

<td>Burning Platform: Usually a burning platform provides focus; but need to avoid "boiling the ocean"; need to manage excessive
expectations</td>

<td>Low Hanging: Low-hanging fruit (easy to identify projects that will yield significant results) are plentiful</td>

<td>Copy Success: Usually replication of the patterns of success already done (similar projects
for similar problems in plants/distribution centers, etc.)</td>

<td>Idea Pipeline: Formal idea-generation/evaluation process in place to ensure continued flow
of meaningful projects; no more low-hanging fruit</td>

<td>Formalized Eval.: Formal idea-generation/evaluation process in place to ensure continued flow of meaningful projects</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<th>People</th>

<td>Driven Few: A few driven believers, rest of the organization mostly skeptical</td>

<td>More Believers: Initial results are helpful; but most of the organization still waiting to see if this will affect them</td>

the organization see a platform that works</td>
